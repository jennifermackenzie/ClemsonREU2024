## "oddN.gp"
used to verify k-4 zeros of odd period polynomials lie on the circle |X|=1/sqrt(N) for N=5, k=10 through 100; N=6, k=10 through 96; N=7, k=10 through 20 and k=30 through 90
 
used to verify the only zero not on the circle |X| = 1/sqrt(N) is X=0

used to consider the conjecture for small N and small k

## "evenN.gp"
used to verify number and locations of zeros for N=5-16, k=10 through 50

used to find the exceptional cases for small N and small k
