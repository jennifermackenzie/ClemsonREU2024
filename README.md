## "oddN.gp"
 used to verify k-4 zeros of odd period polynomials lie on the circle |X|=1/sqrt(N) for N=5, k=10 through 100; N=6, k=10 through 96; N=7, k=10 through 20 and k=30 through 90
 
 used to verify the only zero not on the circle |X| = 1/sqrt(N) is X=0

## "evenN.gp"
 used to verify all k-3 zeros of even period polynomials lie on the circle |X|=1/sqrt(N) for N=5, k=14 through 100
